Cielago Drone CAD files and Process Automation
==============================================
The Cielago project is a proof-of-concept project with dual purpose:
1. To design, publish and improve the Cielago Drone - a 3D-printable, cheap and customizable tiny whoop 65mm FPV drone
2. To experiment with tools and workflows for a more open, collaborative CAD design process, inspired by the open and collaborative nature of software development especially in free software / open source projects.

Thus, our goal is to use this repository to:
* Keep track of the Cielago Drone's source CAD files, which in turn will use open formats or open-source software such as [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/), [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/), etc.
* Create official "releases" of the Drone, by tagging source files and producing artifacts such as STEP files, STL files, PDF plans, build documentation and any other publishable material relativing to a specific version of the drone
* Allow community interaction and contributions in the form of bug reports (on both the drone itself and any supporting files), discussions, pull requests, forks etc.
* Create tooling around process automation - for example using scripts and CI/CD platforms such as GitHub Actions to automate the validation and release process of drone CAD files
* To build software and tooling allowing easier customization of the drone, e.g. creating versions suitable for different hardware components, flight controllers etc. in an automated and "native" way.
* To collect knowledge around open collaboration in CAD projects

Some of these goals are easily obtainable. 
Some of these goals are lofty and may never be achieved. 

We plan to succeed, or die trying. 

# The Drone
Cielago is a tiny quadcopter - more specifically, it is a 65mm tiny whoop FPV drone. It is designed to be cheap, easy to print, build and fly, easy to fix and easy to customize. It is printable with common materials and consumer printers, and relies on widely available parts. 

Accessibility is key here - due to their light weight, propellor guards and limited range, tiny whoops are known as safe to fly even by inexperienced drone pilots. They can be safely flown indoors. Best of all, you don't have to worry about breaking a cheap 3D printed drone - it *will* break, and you *will* quickly rebuild it and continue flying.
